# Sign Language Translation App

## Overview
This repository hosts a Sign Language Translation App developed using Laravel for the web framework and Python for the AI components. The application aims to bridge the communication gap between sign language users and non-sign language users by providing real-time translation and interpretation.

## Features
- **Real-Time Translation**: Convert sign language gestures into text or spoken language.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built with Laravel to ensure a smooth and intuitive user experience.
- **AI-Driven**: Utilizes Python's machine learning and computer vision libraries to accurately detect and interpret sign language gestures.
- **Multi-Language Support**: Capable of translating sign language to multiple spoken languages.
- **Scalable and Secure**: Leveraging Laravelâ€™s robust framework to ensure the application is scalable and secure.

## Technology Stack
### Frontend
- **HTML/CSS**: For the basic structure and styling of the application.
- **JavaScript**: Enhances interactivity and real-time updates on the user interface.
- **Vue.js**: Integrated for a dynamic and reactive user interface.

### Backend
- **Laravel**: Provides a robust and scalable framework for backend operations, including user authentication, API routes, and database management.

### AI Component
- **Python**: Used for developing the AI models that interpret sign language gestures.
  - **TensorFlow/PyTorch**: Deep learning frameworks used for training and deploying the gesture recognition models.
  - **OpenCV**: Library used for real-time computer vision tasks, including gesture detection.
  - **Flask**: Lightweight web framework for serving the AI model as an API.

### Database
- **MySQL/PostgreSQL**: For storing user data, translations, and other persistent information.
